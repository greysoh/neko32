# Neko32
Neko32 is a fantasy computer on steroids.
## Warning: Not stable!
This is in active development, and is very unstable. Especially the rust based CPU.
## Developing
This is stub documentation, but you **MUST** get the git hook working:
```sh
npm install # in root repo
git config --local include.path ../.gitconfig
```
